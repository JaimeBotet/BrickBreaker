# Develop your first Project with JavaScript : Brick Breaker üî®üß±

In this project we are going to **put into practice** all the previous knowledge learnt in the master to develop a project of our choice  **using JavaScript**

## The Project

In this PROJECT we have created a **brick breaker**  classic computer game that allows us to enter a **username** and keeps the score record while we destroy bricks.

### What are the main objectives in this project?

- Improve your knowledge of **JavaScript**
- Put into practice CSS, HTML and JavaScript
- Manage your own project

## Folder organization

Since this was a begginer project, the folder organization is very 'light'
- BrickBreaker_Jaime: this is the root folder that contains:
    
    -_src_: folder that contains both the css style and the JS code
    -_index.html_: the HTML main file
    -_.gitignore_
    -_README.MD_: this file

## Instructions

User must enter their name and click start, the game then automatically starts.
We start breaking bricks with the ball that bounces against our paddle (that we control with the mouse or keyboard arrows), walls, roof or bricks:

-If the ball touches the ground where the paddle is not located, then you lose, the screen changes and it shows you the score.

-If you destroy all the bricks you win, the win screen appears.
